## About this project
This project was orginaly made for a private server. I recently found a **"paid"** loading screen, and I think we don't need to pay for that kind of script. All servers can have a cool and hype loading screen withouth paying it. So i made one **free**.

I'm a french guy who love to made web things free :)

You can donate me if you want to help me in my work  [here](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=WAAU3DKXJXFR6) ;)

You can go on my website (under construction and french site) [here](http://iklem.livehost.fr)

I'll promise this script will not be a **paid script**
